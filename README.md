# Sudoku
A game build for Avans Hogeschool (3th semester).

# How to run
First check if you've got the Sudoku.dll and Sudoku.tld in the folder: Sa-Week4-Sudoku. It should be there but could go wrong because of a early commit. If you do not have it in your folder:
Get the Sudoku.dll and Sudoku.tlb from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1TMiRaT2NH6RDJpQ2JTUkh4bzg&usp=sharing
Put them in the folder: Sa-Week4-Sudoku

Then:
- Edit the register.bat (notepad)
- Define the path to the folder on your computer
- Run as admin
- Go to Visual Studio
- - Right click on "Sa-Week4-Sudoku"
- - Add -> reference
- - Com -> Search "Sudoku"
- - Make sure "Sudoku Game" is on
- - Save.

You're now ready to run the application.
